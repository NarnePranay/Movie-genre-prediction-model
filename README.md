# Movie-genre-prediction-model

1. Implemented a Deep Neural Network Model by following Ensemble learning approach to predict the movie genre given its subtitles. 
2. We used dialogues per minute and words per minute parameters.
3. Implemented two models: one using by preprocessing the data and removed Hearing Impaired subtitles and another model using only hearing Impaired text.
